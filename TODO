Version 0.1
    - Fix NPE when reload server. Possibly something with inventory.
    - Fix load and unload for inventory. - Confirm that it's fixed.
    - Add configuration nodes. And be sure it's flexible for future changes.
    - Add pages support for list and help commands - adminonline45
    - Add ability for tamed wolves to have some kind of armor. Like a diamond block in it's inventory. - Needs to be looked over and improved.

Version 0.2
	- Implement wolf cursors on maps. And make it possible to display information in maps.
    - Change world in database when wolf switch world.
    - Add wolf age. Will be minecraft days/years from it's tamed.
    - Add guard wolf's if you make wolf sit with a sword, wolf will attack any entity that is 5 blocks away.
    - Wolf home. By default set it where the wolf was tamed?
    - Add support for tamed wolves to be teleported to other worlds if player use portal.
    - Set wolf sit when open inventory and set them stand up when close inventory. (Will need InventoryOpenEvent and InventoryCloseEvent).

Ideas:
    - Add parent system so new wolves appear (New wolves spawn wildlife at parent).
    - Add ability for wolves to eat food (pork) from it's inventory when get damaged.
    - Add ability for owner of a wolf to add friendly players that wolf don't attack.
    - Add feature to let player put items in wolf's inventory that it can dispense. Eventually at target.
    - Economy support. Maybe use the Register API.
    - Add wolf shops, so a player can setup a sign and sell one of the tamed wolves. When a player buy a wolf, wolf's owner should change to the buyer.
    - Add ability to set wolf sitting, or enter other minecart when player enter minecart or other vehicles.
    
    compgurusteve:
    Would anyone want to try to tackle this? I was thinking mainly having a set "pen" the player makes with fences and have it spawn a new 'untamed' wolf only if there were 2 wolves lured inside created pen. Anything additional thoughts?
